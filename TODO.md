## Phase 2.5: Security Hardening (Post-CVE Wave — URGENT)

- [ ] MicroVM sandbox backend — `forge exec --sandbox=firecracker` with Firecracker integration
- [ ] Sandbox integrity verification — runtime probes to confirm isolation is actually enforced

- [ ] `forge undo` — universal agent undo (revert file mutations, git commits, entire sessions)
- [ ] `forge snapshot` — environment checkpoints (files + git state + env vars)
- [ ] Agent output quality scoring — multi-dimensional (correctness, style, security, cost)
- [ ] Agent A/B testing framework — blind comparison with statistical significance

## Phase 2.5: Prompt Engineering

- [ ] Prompt template management — `.forge/prompts/` with versioning and variable interpolation
- [ ] Prompt regression testing — test prompt variants against multiple models
