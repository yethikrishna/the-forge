## Anti-Roadmap — Explicitly NOT Building (Yet)
- ~~`forge canvas`~~ → CLI-first; visual builders are a different product
- ~~K8s Operator / Terraform Provider~~ → Enterprise, after GA
- ~~WASM plugins~~ → Go plugins first; WASM ecosystem immature
- ~~A2A protocol~~ → MCP winning; A2A adoption slower than expected
- ~~ForgeConf~~ → Needs 5K+ community first
- ~~`forge desktop` (Electron)~~ → Web dashboard + CLI cover 95%

## Revenue Roadmap
- [ ] Month 1-3: Free OSS + GitHub Sponsors
- [ ] Month 4-6: Pro tier ($20/mo) — cloud sync, analytics, team features
- [ ] Month 6-9: Marketplace (30% of agent/plugin sales)

- [x] Fixed forgegraph deterministic IDs (replaced UnixMilli with counter)
- [x] Fixed snapshot package to match snap_cmd API
- [ ] Continue: comprehensive tests for all new packages
- [ ] Continue: security hardening (input validation, sanitization)

### Expanded Consolidation Plan (From Brainstorm #14)
- [ ] Governance stack: relay + ledger + covenant + policy → internal/governance
- [ ] Declarative stack: blueprint + forgefile + pipeline + workflow → clarify hierarchy or merge
- [ ] Code understanding: navigate + codegraph + index + search → internal/codeknowledge
- [ ] Code modification: transform + refactor + diff + diffx → internal/codemod
- [ ] Multi-agent agreement: blast + fuse + consensus + debate → internal/agreement
