- [ ] Agent monetization infrastructure — Stripe integration, freemium tiers, invoice generation

## Phase 5.5: Strategic Roadmap — Top 10 Priorities (Definitive)

1. [ ] **Package consolidation** — 148 → ~80 packages, freeze Phase 0
2. [ ] **60-second demo video** — record `brew install` → `forge quickstart` → value, post everywhere
3. [ ] **Web dashboard (real-time)** — WebSocket monitoring, cost charts, replay, traces
4. [ ] **Plugin marketplace MVP** — git-based registry, publish/install/version
5. [ ] **Provider resilience** — complete circuit breaker + auto-fallback + incident reports
6. [ ] **forge.yaml schema + IDE autocomplete** — JSON Schema, VS Code association, `forge config validate`
7. [ ] **Documentation website** — command reference, tutorials, architecture guide, comparisons
8. [ ] **Cross-package event correlation** — unified incident analysis across all subsystems
9. [ ] **Agent trust scores + permission scoping** — trust 0-100, `--scope=read-only`, action preview
10. [ ] **Forge Cloud sync (MVP)** — sync agents/memory/pipelines across machines

## Anti-Roadmap — Explicitly NOT Building (Yet)
- ~~`forge canvas`~~ → CLI-first; visual builders are a different product
- ~~K8s Operator / Terraform Provider~~ → Enterprise, after GA
- ~~WASM plugins~~ → Go plugins first; WASM ecosystem immature
- ~~A2A protocol~~ → MCP winning; A2A adoption slower than expected
- ~~ForgeConf~~ → Needs 5K+ community first
- ~~`forge desktop` (Electron)~~ → Web dashboard + CLI cover 95%

## Revenue Roadmap
- [ ] Month 1-3: Free OSS + GitHub Sponsors
- [ ] Month 4-6: Pro tier ($20/mo) — cloud sync, analytics, team features
- [ ] Month 6-9: Marketplace (30% of agent/plugin sales)
- [ ] Month 9-12: Enterprise (per-seat annual license)
- [ ] Month 12+: Platform (Agent-as-a-Service hosting fees)

## Phase 6: Implementation Design (From Brainstorm #9)
